## Description
[⬆ Back to the conents](#contents)

Backend (capstone?) project for a distributed E-Learning Management System (LMS) developed fully in Go-Lang.

## Objectives
[⬆ Back to the conents](#contents)

- Creating an easy to maintain backend project.
- Using go-lang and learning it from scratch with this project.
- Create a Learning Management System that can actually be deployed.
- Creating a Postman collection for every user to use.

## Motivation
[⬆ Back to the conents](#contents)

I wanted to learn Go for so long, like, years even, but it was always I said I'd do later on, this is later on and I'm doing it. Part of the idea was, not only seeing Go on my feed, but this particular video, [Rust or Go for my next project? WHAT TO CHOOSE? (as a senior intern engineer)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbmvbXPj8Fs).

Go is a programming language developed and maintained by Google, a quite popular bussiness or so they say, it was one of my (technical) objectives for 2022. I've head good things about it's concurrency and it's simplicity, how it manages packages/modules and dependencies, how easy-to-understand the codebase can be and it's efficiency. I also really like the idea that it is compiled, it's been a long time since I have worked with compiled languages, and, as far as it goes, Java is not on my priorities, for the moment being that is.

Another plus is that it's strongly typed. And, finally, obviously, it offers it's own testing packages.

## Tech Stack
[⬆ Back to the conents](#contents)

- **Golang**, as aforementioned, a popuplar compiled language developed by Google that allows concurrency and offers a type system.
- **MySQL**, a relational database for SQL, and it's the one I'm the most comfortable with.
